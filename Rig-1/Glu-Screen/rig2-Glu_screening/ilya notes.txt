METAMORPH



these are for calcium i think

CELL ANALYSIS
MATLAB 2016
writes stage positions for metamorph (.STG files) 


QUICK PLATE SCREEN TO TEST FOR EXPRESSION
must get focus positions at 40X, then scan at 10 (or 20)X

1. Run laser-focus
2. ref_main (calls ref_autofocus_single)


THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM IN MM
1. Threshold image (low of ~842)
2. Select image in well that has max thresholded area. Show region statistics > Spatial statistics > Threshold Area or % threshold area
	programmatically: ShowRegionStatistics.ThresholdedArea 



Time for initial autofocus (using 40x, laser-focus program): 5 min


RELATIVE MOTIONS
origin (Y): 6993. 
cropped sensor: 1 FOV = 370 steps (some overlap). One well is ~12 FOVs across (diameter)

uncropped sensor: > 600 steps. Can't do that with e-stimulator. Made it move 400 steps.

positive Y: stage moves towards user
positive X: stage moves right


stim with 1, 3, 10, 40 APs

ref image naming
<StreamSavePath>\<Plate_name>_<AFStageLabel>_X<stage X position>_Y<stage y position>_Z<stage z position>_<type>.tif
where <type> : GFP / BF

stream naming
<StreamSavePath>\<Plate_name>_<AFStageLabel>_X<stage X position>_Y<stage y position>_Z<stage z position>_<type>_sweep_<N>.tif
where <type> : 1AP / 3AP / 10AP / 40AP


GETI imaging settings that work well:
10 ms exposure, 2 binning, ~50 FPS

WaveSurfer: should be 320 sweeps not 384



============== TESTING IMAGE THRESHOLD ================
go to well
Run test_positionTesting
	It will error out but that's OK


--------------------------------------11-12-18 experiment
overall takes ~1 hr 20 mins
made actuator rise before taking GFP and BF images (timeseries_inner)

thresholding is working really well to find cells - maybe use that for other screens?

TODO=====
1. fiddle with illum power
	- starting with 2000
2. make sure BF image is good before starting
3. Adjust threshold
4. All the 1AP fluorescent traces have a huge transient component but the subsequent ones don't. clearly visible when looking at video
